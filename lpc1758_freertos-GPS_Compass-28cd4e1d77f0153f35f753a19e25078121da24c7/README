-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get started, have a look at L5_Application/main.cpp and the example tasks.

You can change a #define 0 to #define 1 for one example at a time and look
through the code of each example.

The general idea is to interact with the project through terminal commands.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
See "ChangeLog" for the changes made to the sample project source code.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LED Display
   10: Indicates compass is in heading mode.
   13: Indicates compass is in calibration mode.
   17: Represents irrevalant CAN message.
   
2. Switch
   Switch 1: If switch 1 is pressed compass enters calibration mode.
   Switch 2: If switch 2 is pressed compass enters heading mode.
   
3. CAN1 pins
   P0.0: RD1 
   P0.1: TD1
   
4. I2C pins
   P0.10: SDA2
   P0.11: SCL2

5. LED decode:

   LED 3 (Toggle)          - Toggles for every unsucessful queue send of GPS data.
   LED 3 (On)              - GPS data is not valid
   LED 4 (Toggle)          - Toggles for every unsuccessful read of raw GPS data.
   LED 1 and LED 2 (on)    - GPS Data is not on queue
   LED 1 and LED 2 (off)   - GPS Data is on queue, and is being computed in 10Hz task

6. UART usage:
   UART 2 is used for GPS receive.
